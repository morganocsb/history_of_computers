            <li>This web was made to help with online communication between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. </li>
            <li>When it was all published, this web connected the world in ways that include sites, blogs, video sharing, and more. 
            </li>

            <li>“Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.”</li>
            <li>“We need diversity of thought in the world to face the new challenges.”</li>
            <li>"I hope we will use the Net to cross barriers and connect cultures."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He wanted to bring everyone together with their differences to learn more about things and concepts that others may know more about. He understands how important data is and that data is really valuable and will last longer than the technology used to handle it.</p>
